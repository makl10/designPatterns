designPatterns
==============

Just a bunch of design patterns and other stuff designed in Java.

This is designed to give anyone looking a clear overview of some of the simplest (and most used) design patterns that exist out there. These are all programmed in Java using the Object Oriented tools that are so useful in implementing these design patterns.

Some of the design patterns that can be viewed here:

The Singleton Design pattern that can be seen in the Arriba class which ensures that only one of the Arriba class is instanced at a time and only GameCatalogue is being dealt with at a time.

The Iterator design pattern which can be seen in the GameCatalogue. It allows other classes to iterate through the games in the Game Catalogues.
